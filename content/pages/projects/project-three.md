Conducted a structured cybersecurity analysis on the fictional company Deplorable Art.

Identified key vulnerabilities within their IT infrastructure and assessed the risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad). Applied NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and ISO 27001 controls to recommend mitigations.

Deliverables included:

*   Vulnerability assessment and risk scoring

*   Security control recommendations (CIS, NIST, ISO)

*   Action plan for improving resilience and compliance

This project showcased my ability to apply risk management frameworks to real-world styled scenarios and create a professional security improvement roadmap.
